            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to conclude, <hi>It is a fire, a world of wickedneſſe, an vnruly euill, full of deadly poyſon: Iam.</hi> 3. No maruell therefore, if the Lord, when he ſaw that man by depriuing himſelfe of his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iuſtice, had loſt the true skil of vſing this weapon, did now ſomewhat ſhorten the length of it, to the end that ſome proportion might bee found betweene the wounded and worne Souldier, and his vnweeldie blade. Had <hi>Adam</hi> ſtill continued in his firſt eſtate, reaſon in him like a golden bridle would haue kept this member in ſubiection; <hi>At hi iam mortui ſunt,</hi> thoſe Armes which then were luſty and ſtrong, haue now loſt their vigor, and the tongue as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed beaſt runnes ouer all it meetes with, and tramples to the ground all ſuch as giue it not way and paſſage. God therefore ſince the Rider had not any
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8072:24"/>longer the free power to reſtraine his beaſt, thought good to ſhorten his race, ſcantle his liberties, and reduce the large Common where before it roued, and went aſtray into ſeuerall incloſements. <hi>Shemeis</hi> tongue may bee free in curſing, but it ſhall boote no where now but in <hi>Iurie.

                  <p>From hence wee may obſerue many points worth our conſideration, as firſt, that all the puniſhments which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to inflict on the wicked in this life, are no other then ſo many ſteps and ſtaires to promote the welfare of his Church. For howſoeuer, the World abounded as much with wicked after, as before, yet men being deuided into as many factions as tongues, and hauing not ſo free commerce as before, the Church might now ſeeme to haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8072:24"/>ſhare, being compared with any one part, though to all it beare no proportion. Secondly, wee may note the end of Gods puniſhments, how it is to repreſſe the ragings of ſinne,<note place="margin">Greg. lib. <hi>34</hi> Moral. &amp; Chryſoſt. in Gen. c. <hi>11.</hi> v. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> and to reſtraine it from growing to that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious hight which theſe builders had raiſed it vnto. For no doubt, the Lord ſeeing the imaginations of mans heart to be euill continually, and that this vnitie of ſpeech ſo much ſerued the wicked to win them partners in their wickedneſſe, vſed this confuſion of Languages as a bridle to curbe their audacious ſpirits, that if notwithſtanding all this, they ſhould haue as much will to ſinne, yet ſhould they haue leſſe power to hurt: and though perhaps there might bee as many wicked, yet ſhould there be fewer partakers in the ſame wickedneſſe. Alas, God might, as hee did to <hi>Sodome,</hi> haue rained downe fire and brimſtone vpon them, and ſo haue conſumed their work with them, but then he had not left vs the poſteritie of that wicked conſort, as a perpetuall argument of his mercy: he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8072:25"/>might with Lighthings or Earthquakes haue demoliſht their worke, and not them: but then hee had onely deter'd them from proceeding in that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, not taken away the meanes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a new. Wherefore hee like a prudent Iudge, that this <hi>malum poenae,</hi> this puniſhment which he would inflict vpon them, might take ſome effect in all their Poſterity, ſuits their puniſhment to their offence: the vnity of lunguage cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to incite one another to build, and the conſuſion of Languages ſhall for euer take from them the meanes to proceed; ſimilitude of ſpeech, made them ſeeke a combination, and a diuerſitie of ſpeech ſhall cauſe their final ſeperations; likeneſſe of Tongues, made them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne in conſultation, and diuiſion of Tongues ſhall deuide their humors and affections.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8072:25"/>God by this confuſion of languages eſtabliſhed in the world. I cannot tell what others may coniecture, but, mee thinkes, it cannot bee but a fond imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Papiſts, to think that now all Nations ſhould againe conſpire and agree vnder one viſible head: did God ſo miraculouſly ſcatter &amp; diuide men, leſt being vndiuided they ſhould againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their vomit, and their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders incite them afreſh to hatch ſuch Monſters as this was; and muſt all Mankind ſubiect it ſelfe once more to the command of one <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and all concurre to the rayſing of a ſecond <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel?</hi> I confeſſe with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the third of his Politickes, that a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is the beſt forme of Regiment abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and the beſt in one Citie and one Countrey, as moſt ſymbolizing with the order of nature, and beeing the beſt preſeruer of Vnitie and Concord, which is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> mayne ground; yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the manifold defects of men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which this confuſion of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages is not the leaſt; (and therefore

                  <p>True it is, that <hi>Amaziahs</hi> counſell was of as good touch, as the flattering lips of worldly friends do vſe to impart; who begges not attention, or inoculates not his faithfull endeauours into his Friends Creed and Beliefe, with a Tale of <hi>vtile,</hi> profit, commoditie?

                  <p>In the <hi>Negatiue,</hi> we may conſider the termes, firſt, <hi>abſolutely</hi> in themſelues, <hi>A Prophet, a Prophets Sonne;</hi> Secondly, <hi>with relation to</hi> Amos, <hi>I was no Prophet, I was no Prophets Sonne;</hi> In the <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue,</hi> we may obſerue likewiſe (if the time could permit) the Trades hee was of; the <hi>one</hi> about Cattell, <hi>I was an Heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> about the fruits of the earth, <hi>I was a gatherer of Sycomore fruit.</hi> And now haue I preſented before your eyes, the Inauguration, or Generation rather (if I may ſpeake <hi>Phyſically</hi> in a Diuine ſubiect) of a Prophet, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, <hi>à non eſſe adeſſe,</hi> his <hi>terminus à quo &amp; ad quem,</hi> it is a ſampler of our new birth in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where the Author of all Propheſie by the anoynting Oyle of his Spirit, takes vs from amongſt the heards,

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the word <hi>Prophet,</hi> hath euer enioyed a ſacred and religious vſe, and although the Heathens were guiltie of that Sacrilege, that they ſtole it from the Church to adorne their <hi>Poets</hi> with it, yet in its owne right, it ſtill contayned it ſelfe within the Arke of the Couenant, and the Offices of the Sanctuary, and in them receiued a three-fold acception. For <hi>firſt,</hi> and moſt vſually it noted that

Now <hi>relatiues</hi> being beſt knowne by their <hi>correlatiues,</hi> the ſureſt way to find out the meaning of this word <hi>Prophet</hi> in my Text, will be by his ſonnes, <hi>quaelis filius talis pater,</hi> Like ſon, like father. A Prophets ſonne in the old Teſtament, is not the ſonne of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſo termed, for generation or adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; no, this were to hold the graces of God in fee ſimple, and to entaile them to a Stocke or Linage, but for inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and education ſake. They are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſundry times in the Bookes of <hi>Kings,</hi> and by the circumſtances of the places, as alſo the concurrence of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, are found to be nothing elſe but young Students, trained vp vnder reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and learned Teachers, as in Schooles and <hi>Accademies</hi> of pietie. A <hi>Prophet</hi> then in this place (by the nature of <hi>relatiues</hi>) is the Maſter or Teacher; and a Prophets ſonne, the Scholer and Auditor in a Vniuerſitie. Yet giue me leaue to affirme the roote of a Prophet in my Text (I ſpeake not <hi>grammatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>)
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8072:42"/>for this is denied by many, but <hi>hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically</hi> to bee Prophets inſpired, who haue as it ſeemes, bequeathed the name of Prophet, vpon ſuch Inſtructors as theſe, becauſe they were the Founders of the Order, and their Predeceſſors in the Chaire.

And if the caſe ſtands ſo with the Maſter, that hee hath this ſacred name of a Prophet pind on his ſleeue for a monitor, how doth the Prophets ſonne reflect vpon the Scholer. Doubtleſſe no otherwiſe, then a picture doth vpon him that it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, I may almoſt ſay, as a definition vpon that which it defines. For, not to ſpeake with that rigor in <hi>Logick,</hi> a ſonne may analogically be the <hi>matter,</hi> and a Prophet the <hi>forme;</hi> the one the <hi>genus,</hi> the other the <hi>differentia,</hi> in the definition of a Scholer or Diſciple. Take the common qualities of a ſonne with the reſtringent qualifications of a Prophet, and they make that ſweete harmonie which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> found in Brethren that dwell together in vnitie: For as a naturall father begets the body of his ſonne, ſo a Prophet informes the ſoule of him, and no leſſe reſtores that life which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, then the other that which it neuer had.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8072:49"/>the Prophets their ſpirituall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to their ſonnes, and make them heires not by halues as the Pope, but of all that they haue. And laſtly, as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſonne is a part of his fathers family, ſo whoſoeuer is truly the ſonne of a Prophet, is incorporated into the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Prophet, ſubmits himſelfe to liue in ranke and place and obedience of a ſonne; if otherwiſe, he either takes the Cell and Hermitage he liues in, to bee a Kings Palace, and a Schoole of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or with curſed <hi>Eſau</hi> contemnes his Birth-right,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The beſt inuentions we ſee are liable to abuſe; The Deuill hath in all Trades ſome bound apprentiſe vnto him, whom he teacheth ſome myſteries or other aboue their fellowes.

In the Scripture, what

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8072:70"/>come and take away our place, Ioh.</hi> 11. Thus doe thoſe arguments drawne, <hi>à vtili,</hi> ſway the world, whereof our times doe yeeld pregnant teſtimonies. Looke out into the Shrines of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries; if they were erected onely for the aduancement of Religion and Pietie, their accuſations againſt vs, might carrie more authoritie in their foreheads, but if they be but the Popes Exchequors, and their Prieſts, but like the Publicans which ſit at the receit of cuſtome, pretend what they can, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage what they will, their quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs is but the ſame of <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the Craftſ-men againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> they fight not ſo much, <hi>pro aris</hi> as <hi>pro focis,</hi> I may engliſh it, for the Chappell as the Kitchen.</p>
                  <p>But my deſire is to make my appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation more generall. You haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto beheld the condition and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Pauls</hi> accuſers, <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the Craftſ-men with him are now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and Time, which hath deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red itſelfe, hath alſo eaten vp both their

I mind not to impoſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, that the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> is yet ſtanding, no, the ruines of that wonder are intombed within the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals of the Earth, which once bare it; but, good God, other Deities doe now bring gaines to the Craftſ-men, and which is to bee pitied rather or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I cannot tell, ſuch as feare no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod but the diſſolution of the world,

What Shrines are now erected to Intemperancie, what Altars to Pride, what Phanes to Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Let <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe diſſwade his auditors from approaching of theſe Temples, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> with the Craftſ-men will crie out, <hi>Our Craft by this man is in danger to be ſet at nought.</hi> Thus are the Preachers of the Word thought ill Common-wealths men, when they ſeeke to enlarge the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Church, and to beat downe the Forts of Sathan. If wee perſwade Sobrietie, then thoſe Cages of vncleane birds, thoſe Sinkes of drunkenneſſe, exclaime, we depriue them of their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes; If wee wound Pride, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Vanitie, Faſhions grow out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and their Inuenters ſit downe with loſſe; If we preach Charitie and Conſcience, Vſurers feare that their dealings are cenſured and their gaines queſtioned; If wee touch Simonie, how many Patrons thinke the Church
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8072:71"/>would depriue them of ſome part of their iuſt inheritance? O what Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians are the Deuils ſcholers, how ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Sophiſters are they in framing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions through all figures and moods. Had Saint <hi>Paul</hi> beene Paſtor of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and then challenged <hi>Demetrius</hi> for detayning ſome Tithe or Gleabe from him, it had beene no vnaccuſtomed Plea, if <hi>Demetrius</hi> had enflamed the Artificers with, it is your owne caſe; but when <hi>Paul</hi> onely preacheth <hi>Christ</hi> vnto the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and winnes them vnto his Goſpell, what <hi>Enthemems,</hi> what <hi>Conſequences</hi> muſt <hi>Demetrius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre one vpon the necke of another, before he can make <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching to be either his owne or the Craftſ-mens vndoing? I congratulate here (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) the humilitie of Diuine Sciences, which hauing ſequeſtred, as it were, themſelues from the corruption of the World, doe with a dutifull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of ſuperioritie, without theſe repinings ſubmit themſelues to the correction and checke of Gods
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8072:72"/>Word; Indeed <hi>Demetrius</hi> might giue a good reaſon of this quiet and ſtill temper of <hi>Mercurie;</hi> for in dealing in principles of Arts and Sciences, the Preacher toucheth no mans commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for what was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the richer for denying <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the World, or <hi>Democritus</hi> the poorer for affirming it? what is <hi>Galilaeus</hi> the wealthier for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying mountaines in the Moone, or <hi>Kepplenus</hi> the leſſe landed for not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them? to be a <hi>Nominalist</hi> or to be a <hi>Realist</hi> are held matters of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance amongſt ſome, and yet make the moſt they can of Vniuerſals, <hi>genus &amp; ſpecies cogitur ire pedes.</hi> I thinke that neither of them will make any great market of either. But deſcend to other Problemes, conuince Briberie, tax Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, diſſwade Depopulation; or if you liſt to looke ouer ſea, and denye the Popes Eccleſiaſticall and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Iuriſdiction, or queſtion Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, his Market-towne; Indulgences and Pardons, his Ware; now you touch Saint <hi>Peters</hi> copie-hold, theſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8072:72"/>bold Preachers muſt looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, there want not <hi>Demetriuſes</hi> and Craftſ-men enough to accuſe them. But here you may behold as in a Mirrour, the ſtate of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Meſſengers in this Church militant vpon Earth; you may ſee what Bands of <hi>Atheiſts;</hi> what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Epicures,</hi> what Legions of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous <hi>Mammons,</hi> they neceſſarily doe prouoke and incenſe againſt them. The Generall of theſe Troupes is not a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily but a ſpirituall Enemie, whoſe Dragon eyes pries into all aduantages againſt them, intermits no time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap them, no ſtratagem to ſubdue them. Now, what ſafetie can there be for ſimple Innocencie, where there is ſo vigilant a Captaine, ſo officious Souldiers? <hi>Antichrist</hi> may come with Peace in his mouth, when hee hath Warre in his heart; hee may court it with the flatteries of an Harlot, when either hee hath Poyſon in his cup, or Powder-plots in his head; wee, where Chriſt hath ſet vp his Flagge of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, muſt deliuer his Meſſage in his

And how ſhould the chance fall otherwiſe? for thinke you that the world will now brooke a checke of our rudeneſſe, when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine eloquence of the Apoſtles was ſo
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8072:73"/>harſh vnto it? or will the ſonnes of the Earth ſuffer without indignation the leaſt diminution of their riches by our meanes, when they welcommed S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe with ſuch affronts for attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it? nay, rather periſh Religion, fall Churches, ceaſe prayers; be forfeited all the treaſures and conduits of grace to the vttermoſt racke of Saluation, &amp; the loſſe of Heauen to boote. But I hope better things of this Auditorie, I truſt (right Honourable) that your graue wiſedomes will bee a Sanctuarie vnto thoſe which are accuſed by <hi>Demetrius</hi> or their factious complices. Magiſtrats, as the beſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion they can ſhew for their authoritie, is the Word written; ſo the beſt Agents they haue to cauſe that their commands are executed, are the Miniſters of this Word. You deale not with Barbarians but Chriſtians, this is our labour; your lawes are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, not of conſtraint, but willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; this is our diligence: you are obeyed, not for feare, but conſcience; this is our induſtrie. O what an happy

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8072:83"/>of Lamech, hearken vnto my ſpeech;</hi> the other, that his conſcience told him, a preſumptuous and brauing murder to be as odious in Gods ſight as an inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>If Cain ſhall be auenged ſeuen fold, truly Lamech ſeuentie ſeuen fold, Gen.</hi> 4.24.

                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.</note> makes nothing for their purpoſe, for beſides, that he was licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Saul</hi> the King to enterpriſe this action, all writers doe agree, that hee did it by an immediate inſtinct from God, wheras theſe do it by an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate inſtinct from the Deuill.

But admit that theſe challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges did not contradict the Lawes of God, nor abrogate the authoritie of the Magiſtrate; to whom the execution of Iuſtice appertaineth, yet lets conſider the little ſatisfaction which can ariſe from theſe Duels to the party wronged. And becauſe there is a new kind of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie inuented for this practice, I wil examine it acording to the grounds of Philoſophie vſually deliuered, that ſo
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:8072:84"/>thoſe which are now trained vp among vs, may when they come into the world remember, how farre differing theſe combates are from thoſe rudiments which they once embraced. A man you know hath diuers conſiderations, either in generall, whereby hee may bee wronged in his <hi>Naturals,</hi> by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him dull, heauy or ſottiſh; in his <hi>Moralls,</hi> by ſtiling him diſhoneſt, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate or couetous; in his <hi>Politickes,</hi> by branding him with Traytor, or Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Law, or elſe a man may come to bee conſidered in ſome particular ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or profeſſion which hee is of, as <hi>Diuine, Lawyer, Phiſician, Tradeſ-man,</hi> or the like. Now let mee aske the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, when a man chanceth to bee wronged any of theſe wayes, how doth the Field redeeme his credit, which hee thinkes is diminiſhed. Lying, Couze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, or Folly is obiected to you, and you would diſproue it in ſingle ſight; hereby indeed you argue your ſelfe, if you vanquiſh, to be a better fencer then the other, or more nimble and ſtrong,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8072:85"/>but who obiected a want of theſe things vnto you? who caſt a defect of them in your teeth. <hi>Oppoſita</hi> muſt bee <hi>ad idem,</hi> you cleare your ſelfe of that which was neuer obiected to you, that which you were vpbraided with, that you anſwer not, no more then if two Painters ſhould contend about their skil in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and he ſhould bee preferred which ouercame at the point of weapon. But ſome will ſay, is ſingle fight therefore wholly vnlawfull; Ile vnfold my para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe in few words, ſingle Combats are not onely lawfull but alſo neceſſarie, but what Combats are they? why, ſuch as are performed by weapons ſutable to the quarrell; if the contention be about cunning and skill, ſhew by skill and cunning that the victorie ought to fall on thy ſide; if about honeſty, let honeſty by actions proportionable to it ſelfe vanqiuſh the accuſer; if about wiſdome, let diſcreet proceedings quell the ſpirit of the ditractor; if about Religion, let Deuotion, Sanctitie, Obedience, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Charitie, enter the liſts and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8072:85"/>fight for thee. Here thou doſt all things contrary to reaſon, thou ſtormeſt that thou art not held vertuous, and in this action declareſt, that thou canſt no more moderate thy affections then a mad beaſt, thou fretteſt that any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thy reputation to be weak or ſick, and in this remedie, thou diſcouereſt thy ſelfe like an vnſound bodie, which no ſore is touched but cries out; thou wouldeſt make thine aduerſarie repent him which wronged thee; but thou bringeſt the greater repentance vpon thy ſelfe; thou wouldeſt maintaine the credit of thy familie, but thou ſtaineſt it with bloud &amp; vnchriſtian-like actions, thou wouldeſt bee highly eſteemed of by others, but thou ſheweſt a baſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of thy ſelfe, who prizeſt thy life at ſo low a rate, as a few raſh ſpeeches of an enemy. Time is too precious to be waſted the purſute of ſuch <hi>ignis fatui,</hi> ſuch braynes which conceiue nothing but phantaſmes and apparant meteors of true Fortitude. I know that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare outwardly, like <hi>Sehons</hi> and <hi>Ogges,</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:8072:86"/>or as the ſonnes of <hi>Anake,</hi> to affrighten <hi>Iſrael</hi> with their bigge words and loftie ſpeeches, yet I doubt not, but many punies heere meanely grounded in the rudiments of Philoſophie, would with eaſe ſo abaſe their high looke in a iuſt diſputation at this time, that they ſhould rather ſeeme the Graſſe-hoppers of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or fained <hi>Pigmyes,</hi> ſuppoſed by Geographers beyond <hi>Lapland.</hi> Yet, if thy conſtitution bee ſo vnproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably tempered with the elements, that nothing will ſatisfie thee but fighting and combating, I will ſhew you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duell which is behoofefull for thee to accept.

<pb n="585" facs="tcp:8072:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>prouidence, doth ſome action, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the effect therof from God alone, no iuſt or neceſſarie cauſe mouing him thereunto. So then, the rules whereby wee are to examine this tempting of God, are chiefly two; Firſt we muſt look into the <hi>end,</hi> and ſee whether it bee too make an experiment of ſome perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in God, whereof wee doubt; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we muſt examine the <hi>Meanes</hi> and <hi>Neceſsitie;</hi> whether, though we doe it not, as doubting of any perfection in God; yee, wee either neglect therein the owne ordinarie meanes afforded vs by God, for the effecting of the ſame thing, or elſe haue no iuſt and neceſſary cauſe, to flie ſo to him in ſuch a matter. If wee erre in the former, it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tempting of God; if in the latter, then is it an <hi>implicite</hi> and an <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> (as they terme it) tempting of him. Now to bring this home to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in my text, and apply their vſing of this extraordinarie meanes to the queſtion in hand. Firſt, the end they had in it, was not to tempt God, or to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8072:102"/>make an aſſay either of his power or wiſedome, or will towards them, but only to relieue their owne neceſſities, being now deſtitute of an Head, and in that of ſafetie. Now, God is tempted (ſaith <hi>Auſten</hi>) <hi>cum ſigna flagitantur non ad ſalutem, ſed ad experientiam deſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> when ſignes are ſought, not for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but for experiments ſake; and to ſpeake with <hi>Valentia,</hi> the enquiring of God in ſuch a caſe,<note place="margin">Greg. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alent.

And thus wee ſee that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8072:103"/>this asking of God in my Text, who ſhould goe vp againſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> was not a tempting of God, but rather a conſulting with him in an enterpriſe of religious vſe, and holy ſignification, this extraordinarie manner of enquirie of things of ſo high a nature, whether by lots, or by <hi>Vrim,</hi> by dreames, or Prophets, being permitted to the Church in her infancie, to ſupply the obſcuritie of types, and the paucitie or ſcarcitie of ſacred bookes then extant, which to vs in the new Teſtament, who haue both the one illuſtrated, and the other augmented, were no leſſe then a tempting of God, and a running to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie courſes, where ordinarie meanes are plentifully offered.</p>

The <hi>Canaanites</hi> I am ſure, found not the warre to conclude in <hi>tropes,</hi> but in bloud; and the ſwords of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to cut really, what ere they meant figuratiuely. Now, as the letter ſounds, there is no ſmall contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie amongſt Interpreters, what the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> doe here meane or intend in this their Petition.

Thirdly,</hi> they ſue that it may be vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, and that in two reſpects; the one,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:8072:106"/>in reſpect of themſelues; it was not, who ſhall goe vp for <hi>himſelfe;</hi> but, who ſhould <hi>goe vp for vs;</hi> euery bodies part (as it ſhould ſeeme) lay therein; and this <hi>Iudah</hi> performed as his taske; for, beſides that hee conquered his owne lot, in which he requeſted the aſſiſtance of his brother <hi>Simeon,</hi> Verſ. 3. hee fought alſo for the reſt, as it appeareth in the 4.

                  <p>With what face then can the ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men defend <hi>Thomas</hi> in that paradox of his, which he broacheth, 2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 10. <hi>art.</hi> 10. <hi>Dominium &amp; Praelatio introducta ſunt ex jure humano,</hi> Rule and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie were brought in by the Law of Man. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I confeſſe, in his third Booke, <hi>de Laicis,</hi> and ſixth chapter, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſomewhat the rigour of his Maſter in this point, and ſaith, that politike rule conſidered in generall, is by the Law of Nature, and therefore by the Law of God; but yet conſidered either in ſpeciall, as in a Monarchie or Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie, or any particular perſon that ſuſtaineth it; ſo it is onely by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Men and by poſitiue Law. But it ſeemes that <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Logike is not the ſame with ours, for if it were, hee could not be ignorant, that <hi>quod praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur de genere, praedicatur de ſpecie &amp; indiuiduo,</hi> that which is affirmed of the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8072:109"/>generall, may alſo bee affirmed of the ſpeciall and particular; and ſo, if hee makes with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> a <hi>Monarchie, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracie,</hi> or <hi>Democracie,</hi> to bee ſpeciall kinds of a common-wealth, and this or that King to bee an indiuiduall Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, hee cannot denie that to theſe, which he grants to their <hi>genus</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature. I beleeue, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> would not allow of ſuch an anſwere as currant, from one that ſhould doe him wrong; God indeed forbids me to hurt my Neighbour, but not to hurt thee <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> it would bee ſcarce ſafe to preach at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Popes</hi> are the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of <hi>Peter</hi> by the Law of God, but for <hi>Paulus Quinsus,</hi> that now is, hee is <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor onely by the Law of Man. I am ſure, that here in my Text, they come not to God to authoriſe or eſtabliſh a going vp againſt the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> in generall, but rather who ſhould goe vp for them in ſpeciall. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge both from him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſue to him for both. I aske one <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> that great Counſellor of State to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8072:110"/>two Monarchies, and <hi>à ſecretis</hi> to foure Kings, what that <hi>Myſterium Imperij</hi> ſhould be, which tranſlates and entailes Crownes to a Familie, and hee will tell you that it is God, which meditates not vpon Kingdoms, as on <hi>Platonike Ideas,</hi> or <hi>ſumma genera</hi> in a predicament, but deſcends to particulars, <hi>remooues Kings and ſets vp Kings, rules in the Kingdom of men, and appointeth ouer it whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he will, Chron.</hi> 2. and the 5. But here it may bee obiected, if it bee ſo as wee make it, that Princes and Magiſtrates are <hi>jure diuino,</hi> by the Law of God; how comes it about, that in the 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. Kings and Gouernours are ſtiled by no other name, then the <hi>ordinance of man:</hi> this ſeemes to kill and cut the throat of all that which went before. I anſwere briefly, that a thing may be ſaid to be an ordinance of man, three manner of waies: firſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in reſpect of its cauſe and originall. Secondly, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in reſpect of his ſubiect or obiect: And thirdly, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in reſpect of its end. Now, Kings and Gouernors are
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8072:110"/>termed an humane ordinance, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>originall,</hi> as if they were of mans conſtitution; for ſo, as we haue declared, they are of God; but in regard of their <hi>object</hi> and <hi>end,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are conuerſant about hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires, and for that their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſcope is the gouernment and preſeruation of humane ſocietie. Much more might be ſaid of this point, it is a Kingly Theame, and hath found ere now a Royall Dictator to diſcuſſe it. I cannot tell, but preſſing ſo neere the Court, I feare I haue treſpaſſed in the common fault of it, and ſuſpended you too long in the Petition, I paſſe to the Grant, in the which breuitie ſhall make amends: <hi>Iudah ſhall goe vp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And why ſhould <hi>Iudah</hi> goe vp? why ſhould hee bee graced more then all his brethren, with this Royall and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne execution vpon the <hi>Canaanites?</hi> was it becauſe hee ſurmounted the reſt in number and potencie? But God is not wooed with theſe reſpects, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, where he meanes to be ſeene fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:8072:111"/>moſt in the battell himſelfe, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe himſelfe renowne by his owne right Hand, and proper Chiualrie. What then? why, if you pleaſe to looke backe to the fortie nine of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> you ſhall there find the Kingdome bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed by <hi>Iacob,</hi> as a Legacie to <hi>Iudah. Iudah, thou art he, whom thy brethren ſhall praiſe, thy fathers children ſhall bow downe vnto thee, the Scepter ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Iudah, nor a Law-giuer from betweene his feet, vntill Shiloh come.</hi> The <hi>promiſes</hi> of God are ſure hold, they are, <hi>Yea and Amen:</hi> yet becauſe they are performed, not alwaies ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and forthwith, but in their due ſeaſon; therefore it pleaſeth the diuine Prouidence, ſo farre to compaſſionate our weakneſſe, and to apply himſelfe to our infirmities, as to prop vp our feeble beliefes, and to ruine our languiſhing hopes of things ſo long to come, by vouchſafing often glimpſes and taſtes of them, which ſhould ſerue as gages and pawnes vntill the things themſelues be accompliſhed; ſo did hee often renew
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:8072:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>his promiſes to the Patriarks, for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their enioying of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo did hee deale with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnder the Law, by ſignes and propheſies euer now and anon, rowſe them vp to a firme confidence in the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> to come; the ſame method he vſeth with the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Scepter was promiſed them, and they had, I doubt not, conceiued Royall hopes, but the thing was not to be performed, vntil eight hundred yeers and more after the date of the promiſe, where <hi>Dauid</hi> enioyed it; yet God all this while lay not as one that ſlept, or made no account of his Word, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was reckoned vpon or no, but ſtrengthens (as one might ſay) the weake hammes of <hi>Iudahs</hi> credency, with notable and remarkable tokens of his remembrance of them, and ſeemes to continue their Title and Plea to the Kingdome on foot, by giuing them ſometimes ſoueraigne markes and bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it; and otherwhile putting them into poſſeſſion of ſome parcells of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:8072:112"/>Prerogatiues of it. I paſſe by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency giuen them, as the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> affirme, in their paſſage ouer the Red Sea, where they make that Tribe as <hi>dux gregis,</hi> to leade the way. In the march of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of <hi>Arabia.</hi> What place held the Standard of <hi>Iudah</hi> by the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but the firſt? <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. Of what Tribe was their firſt Iudge, hee which deliuered them from the hand of <hi>Cuſhan Riſhathaim,</hi> king of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> but <hi>Othniel</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Kenaz,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah, Iudg.</hi> 3. When the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> aske of God who ſhould goe vp againſt the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> to adminiſter high iuſtice againſt them for their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious fact, whom doth the Lord no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, but <hi>Iudah, Iud.</hi> 20. and to come home to my Text, Whom doth God preferre in this place to that Kingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of diſpoſing the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah. Iudah</hi> ſhall goe vp: as if in this nomination he had ſaid, the Kingdome is <hi>Iudahs,</hi> it is his by my Gift, by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will, and excepting thoſe of his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:8072:112"/>Brethren whoſe graceleſſe demeanour loſt them their birth-right; it is his by the Law of Nature; <hi>Ioſhua</hi> is dead, and doe you aske who ſhall goe vp firſt for you againſt the <hi>Canaanites?</hi> why, by a threefold right, who ſhould but <hi>Iudah?</hi> Behold, in this Royall expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> I renew and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme my Graunt of the Kingdome to him, hee ſhall haue this as a Seale and aſſurance for the future enioying of it, <hi>Iudah ſhall goe vp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then doth God by his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample warrant that fundamentall max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime of State, obſerued as a Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> by almoſt all the renowned Empires that euer were, which entailes Scepters to Tribes, and Crownes to Families. It ſutes not with this place to diſcuſſe the reaſons of State, alleaged <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> by <hi>Aristotle, Machiauil, Bodin, Iohannes Mariana,</hi> and others, whether were more expedient for a common-wealth, to haue their Princely election or ſucceſſion; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in purging and expelling the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:8072:113"/>humours of a politike body, it bee ſafer to trie the ſoueraign vertue which recides in new Slips, or preſume vpon that which hath beene by long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience found in ancient and well proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Stemmes; for mine owne part, I ſhould hold it but a wittie impietie, ſuch as hath beene ſhewed by diuers, in the commendations of exorbitant ſubiects, to magnifie any policie of man, aboue the wiſedome of God, who in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which hee made his ſeate of Majeſtie vpon earth, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he more viſibly reigned, then in any other Empire of the world, annexed the enſignes of Soueraigntie to this one Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and excepting the time of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> which were rather Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, extraordinarily ſtirred vp by God, to deliuer the people from ſome ſpeciall ſeruitude, then ordinarie Magiſtrates; and one <hi>Saul,</hi> from whoſe houſe God rented the Kingdome for his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we find euer after by the expreſſe act of God, the Scepter committed to the ſway of one Family in <hi>Iudah,</hi> euen
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:8072:113"/>the Houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeciall reaſons in Religion; for beſides, that the bleſſed Race of which the <hi>Meſsias</hi> was to come, became by this meanes the more remarkable; the truth alſo of Gods promiſes and threats, which hee extends euen to the fourth generation of them which loue or hate him, is made by ſo much the more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the eyes of men, by how much the glorie of a Familie in this wiſe continued, makes the fortunes of it the more noted and obſerued by the World.</p>
                  <p>And now haue I brought the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> to their wiſhed Port, there ſeemed but one thing wanting to ſecure them of their felicitie, a <hi>Iudah</hi> to goe vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and it is fallen into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. It may be now expected accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſolemnitie of the day, that I ſhould vndergoe the taske of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch;</hi> and no leſſe paralell the fortunes of <hi>Englands</hi> Inhabitants, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then hee that liues of <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> wherein I muſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:8072:114"/>confeſſe the conſtant and euen hand of God ouer his diſtreſſed Church in all Ages, hath made the burden where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I trauaile, capable of a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile birth, which there required the wit and induſtrie of a deepe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. If I would play the Logician, and begin the affinitie and kindred (as one might ſay) of both people, <hi>à nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> a likeneſſe might there be found, they come thus neere, <hi>Iacobi filij, Iacobi ſubditi.</hi> But I liſt rather, to build my compariſons on reall then verbal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſerued miſerable apprentiſhip of bondage, ere they could be free in the land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> wee in more then <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſſe, in the Territories of <hi>Babylon.</hi> They in ſeruitude to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> we to <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Their manumiſſion and freedome was through the red Sea; ours through a Sea more red then it, of bloudie perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. Bleſt were they with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of two moſt famous and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Generals, each of which was an Armie royall in himſelfe; whoſe Faith
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8072:114"/>fought more for the Campe, then the Campe for them. Yet <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt of them ſaw not the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but from the top of a mountaine. He died vpon the entrie; and truly, thoſe yeares in which our cauſe ſeemed to breathe, vnder the firſt Prince that wholly ſhooke off the yoke of Antichriſt, were ſo few,<note place="margin">Ed. VI.</note> that in them wee might more truly be ſaid to behold our libertie in ſpeculation, then to enioy it; to view it, then to vſe it.<note place="margin">Q. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> There followed an inundation of miſerie vpon it; but God, that would not haue vs tempted aboue that wee are able, heard our cryes; and ſent as to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Q. Eliz.</note> ſo to vs a <hi>Ioſhua</hi> to deliuer. Then did the walls of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> like thoſe of <hi>Iericho,</hi> fall downe, not ſo much by the noyſe of warlike Muſicke, as by the blowing of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites,</hi> the preaching of the Word. Then was the Land diuided amongſt the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of God, and the Cities of refuge pointed out, euen all this <hi>Canaan</hi> of ours was a <hi>Sechem,</hi> and a <hi>Ramah,</hi> euen our Citie of refuge to all the perſecuted
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8072:115"/>nations of the world. Then did the light of the Goſpel, no leſſe then the lights of Heauen at the prayer of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> ſtand ſtill in the midſt of our Firmament, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we had ſubiected our enemies to the obedience of it. But <hi>Ioſhua's,</hi> though their fame and glorie bee of immortall temper, and therein they ſeeme to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip the condition of man; yet their earthly Tabernacles are not of ſo dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mettall, as not to ſuggeſt vnto ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing Ages, that they poſſeſſe ſo much of Man in them, as makes them mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. They are lent vnto vs for our ſakes, but wee muſt reſtore them againe for their owne ſakes. And vpon the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſuch Sunnes, how euer the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of Natures law doe leſſen the griefe of it, yet the ſucceeding dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not therefore awhit the leſſe; both the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and we, muſt acknowledge in it, our ſelues ſubiect to the chances and vſuall misfortunes of the night. It is true indeed, that the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> both there and here were much diminiſhed and brought vnder,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8072:115"/>yet were they not wholly as yet caſt out, they dwelt ſtill amongſt the people God, and were as a thorne in their ſides; and now or neuer, when the <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua's</hi> are gone, when the Cloud by day, and Pillar of fire by night, ſeeme to be vaniſht, are they in hope, either to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the Land, or at leaſt, ere a new Sunne ſhould ariſe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for a toleration. And let any ſpeake, whether in this point alſo the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and wee, ſhared not alike in our dangers after the death's of our <hi>Ioſhua's?</hi> And if wee did, then doubtleſſe the ſame reaſons muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force vs alſo, as did them, to ſeeke for ſome one or other in our <hi>Ioſhua's</hi> rooms to goe vp before vs. But of whom ſhould we aske? It is thought that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went to the high Prieſt in thoſe dayes; and therefore ſome would conclude, that wee ſhould aske of the <hi>Pope,</hi> whom they faigne to ſucceed <hi>Aaron</hi> in the high Prieſts Office. But before wee condeſcend to this, two things are to be proued vnto
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8072:116"/>vs; Firſt, that there is a <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> fixt in his Chaire, wherein God doth as viſibly deliuer his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as he did in the high Prieſts breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate; otherwiſe the reaſons will not be alike. And ſecondly, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is the true ſucceſſor of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and not rather of <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> againſt whom wee wanted one to goe vp for vs; for, to whom may more properly be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſaying of <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> in the ſeuenth Verſe of this Chapter. <hi>Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten Kings hauing their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat vnder my table:</hi> Then to the <hi>Pope,</hi> whoſe cutting and paring of the authoritie of Princes, and treading their Crownes vnder his feet, ſpeake no leſſe. Wee ſhould haue alſo asked him, they ſay, who ſhould goe vp to fight for vs; that was indeed expected, his <hi>Breues</hi> were readie drawne; but, I wis, hee would haue ſerued vs with one of his Carpet Kings, that could neither haue fought for vs, for want of thumbs; nor gone vp before vs, for want of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8072:116"/>toes. Well, if wee were not to aske of the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould wee aske of any other <hi>Pope</hi> at home, which ſome make to be the people. But, alas, amidſt ſo many <hi>Canaanites</hi> they lurked and whiſpered ſeditions in euery corner; what abſtract Statiſt could bow the hearts of ſo many thouſands, as it had beene the heart of one man; and if ſome ſuch were to bee found, yet Crownes and Scepters (as wee haue ſhewed) are more then of a humane mold, or a Gold-ſmiths compoſition; they are of God. Then to God were we to goe, and as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſome extraordinarie reuelation, ſo we to the ordinarie courſe which he hath eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed amongſt vs, for the knowing, of who ſhould goe vp before vs. Truly, it was no ſmall thing, that wee were to aske of God in this caſe. It was, <hi>Firſt,</hi> who ſhould goe vp to fight; therein is intimated, the behoofe of militarie skill. <hi>Secondly,</hi> againſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> therein is ſpecified, <hi>genus belli,</hi> the kind of warre, which was to be vndertaken,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8072:117"/>againſt the <hi>Canaanites</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> it was to be performed, <hi>ore gladij,</hi> with the edge of the ſword; but againſt ours, whom Chriſt is to deſtroy with the power of his Word; it is rather to be acted, <hi>gladio oris,</hi> with the ſword of the mouth, not <hi>Marte,</hi> but <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio;</hi> not <hi>baſta</hi> but <hi>calamo. Thirdly,</hi> it was, who ſhould goe vp for vs, not <hi>pro ſe,</hi> for himſelfe onely, or but for his owne lot, as who ſhould fight onely in queſtions of ſupremacie; but <hi>pro nobis,</hi> for vs alſo, in the common cauſe, and driue out the <hi>Canaanile,</hi> as well out of the Countrie, as the Court; and the Suburbs, as the Citie. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> it was, who ſhould goe vp to fight againſt the <hi>Canaanites; first,</hi> that is in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of the battell, &amp; in the firſt ranke, and be able not onely to be directed by others, but learned alſo to act himſelfe, and that <hi>inter primos primus,</hi> chiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the chiefe; and for ſuch a man, God, and none but God, hath anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that we ſhould haue him in <hi>Iudah,</hi> in the Tribe of the Kings, in the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:8072:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſelected by him for the furniſhing of Leaders. It was neither the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Inferiours, nor the plot of Superiours, nor the well-wiſhes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiners, that ſhapes vs our anſwere; but it was the Lord that appointed vs a Captaine, and ſuch a one as was able <hi>to goe vp,</hi> and expertagainſt the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> and willing to bee <hi>for vs,</hi> and moſt worthie to be <hi>firſt,</hi> and all this in <hi>domo lacobi,</hi> in our <hi>Iudah,</hi> that beautifull Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, wherein for ſo many Ages, the ſoueraigntie of this Ile hath taken root.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, it is thine owne right hand that hath planted it, water it with thy dew from aboue; and blow vpon it, that the Spices thereof may flow out, that there neuer faile of that Stocke a <hi>Iudah to goe vp before vs,</hi> vntill the full and perfect fruition of that <hi>Canaan</hi> which thou haſt appointed for vs. This grant for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghoſt, be rendred all praiſe, honor, and glorie, might, maieſtie, and dominion, from this time forth for euermore.</p>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:8072:125"/>darting his beames vpon the Moone, reflect vpon it, before it can ſhine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. The former way Natures reſemblances of the Trinitie are not of ſuch power and force, as that by them a man <hi>in puris naturalibus conſtitutus,</hi> being left to the light of Nature onely, ſhould bee able to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that incomprehenſible depth, no more (ſayth <hi>Philip Mornay</hi> in his fifth Chapter, <hi>De veritate Religionis</hi>) then cyphering Characters can ſhew him the ſumme they import, which was neuer inſtructed in their vſe, though being conſidered <hi>cum indumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> with their perfections and additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they receiue from the light of the Scripture, they make eaſie that doctrine, being to that purpoſe inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thoſe (ſayth one) <hi>qui prius cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderunt quam intellexerunt,</hi> who did firſt beleeue before they vnderſtood.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8072:125"/>of Nature, yet in points concerning the eſſence of God in generall, or his workes of Creation, not illuſtrations onely or a bare fame may be had from the light of Nature, as <hi>Socinus, Oſtoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> and the like, <hi>Samoſatenian Atheiſts</hi> in <hi>Polonie</hi> doe affirme, but alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations and direct concluſions may be deduced.

                  <p>
                     <hi>That ſo much may be knowne of God by the witneſſe of Nature, as is ſufficient to confirme vnto vs, though not his Perſons, or workes of Redemption, yet his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and alſo his handie-worke in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and gouerning of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is in himſelfe inuiſible, and yet <hi>The inuiſible things of him</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.) <hi>that is, his eternall Power and Godhead are ſeene by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, being conſidered in his workes.</hi> To reſolue the members of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:8072:126"/>which Verſe, were to propoſe vnto you a whole ſyſteme of naturall Diuinitie, each part being a ſcale (ſayth <hi>Beza</hi>) which whoſoeuer will aſcend,<note place="margin">Beza in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. ad loc:</note> may by it attaine to the knowledge of Gods eternall Power and Diuinitie. O God, when I conſider the workes of thine hands, the Sun and the Moone which thou haſt created, and that all things which are compriſed within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of them, doe receiue their being and perfection from thee alone, how can I chuſe but aſſent that thou thy ſelfe art moſt perfect, moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall? when I confeſſe that thou art the prime cauſe, and firſt moouer of all things, reaſon were no reaſon, if from hence it concluded not, that there is nothing left which can moue thee, or make thee mutable; when thou alone madeſt the fabrike of the World by thy mightie power, &amp; doeſt now ſway each <hi>iota</hi> thereof by the Scepter of thy Word, it were ſacriledge, ſhould I ſay, thou wert not a Spirit, and that for time, eternall; for place, euery where;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:8072:126"/>for power, omnipotent. Now when in Nature there can bee but one moſt perfect, one immutable, one infinite and omnipotent Eſſence; let it not be preſumption, if I goe a little farther and inferre, that thou, O God, and none but thou, which doſt theſe things, art that one moſt perfect, immutable, infinite, and omnipotent Eſſence. Thus you may perceiue what wings Nature hath yet affoorded Man to ſoare aloft, if hee would but prye into that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cabinet of heauenly treaſure: if wee looke into the foure laſt Chapters of <hi>Iob,</hi> we ſhall ſee God himſelfe, as it were reading a lecture of theſe workes of Nature, that by them he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate his wiſedome, and by them his power and prouidence might bee conceiued. The old Teſtament is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious likewiſe in this ſubiect, there you may ſee how the deuout Saints,<note place="margin">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8072:127"/>tongues to ſet forth his power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> goes ſomething farther, and ſayth, not onely the <hi>inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of God are ſeene by his workes,</hi> but he addes moreouer, that they are ſo farre ſeene, <hi>as to make the Gentiles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe.</hi> And indeed it was the very ſcope of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> in my Text, to teach the <hi>Lyſtrians</hi> thus much, that howſoeuer God left not ſuch witneſſe of himſelfe vnto them as was ſufficient to ſaue them; yet that by his workes of Nature he left them ſuch a witneſſe, as that they diſhonouring his ſacred perſon by Idolatrie, did take from themſelues al matter which might excuſe them.

                  <p>But ſom wil obiect, how may it be ſaid that God exhibits ſuch euident tokens of his goodneſſe to all men, when many
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8072:136"/>feele his rod of correction, and in this life are afflicted with ſundrie and diuers calamities? I anſwere (beloued) and confeſſe, that ſome times God ſeemes to frowne vpon vs, and to menace vs with vtter deſtruction, but yet when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers like drones doe gather honey but from the Hiue, a true Beleeuer ſhould gather it euen from Thiſtles, and when weaker Veſſels beare ſayle onely in a Calme; a true Veſſell of Chriſts ſhould ſayle beſt to his wiſhed Port in a ſtorm. To ſay the truth, it is ſo appointed from the beginning of the World, that afflictions and fierie trials ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes attend the Church, whileſt it wanders in this deſart of Sinne, but ſo farre are they from eclipſing the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of Gods goodneſſe towards it, that rather they doe the more illuſtrate it.

It is
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8072:137"/>vſuall with the Fathers, to compare the Church of the <hi>Arke,</hi>

                  <p>The latter benefits that are here ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in my Text, concerne man more <hi>inwardly;</hi> the firſt whereof toucheth his <hi>Bodie,</hi> when it is ſaid, <hi>Hee fills his heart with food,</hi> the heart being by a <hi>Synecdoche of a part for the whole,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the whole man: becauſe as food is the principall ſtaffe of mans life, ſo the <hi>heart</hi> hath a principall operation in mans food; for it is <hi>Officina ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationis,</hi> the very ſhop, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells vs, where our food is conuerted into bloud. But how farre God extends his fauour of not onely <hi>giuing,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>filling</hi> (as my Text hath it) <hi>our hearts with food,</hi> may well bee queſtioned?

                     <hi>Often was I in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedneſſe.</hi> Now, if God ſo deale with his elect and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen veſſels, which he loues, how may it be ſaid, that he witneſſeth his Godhead euen vnto the Gentiles, a wilde Oliue which he loues not, by ſuch ample bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as filling their hearts with food? The ſumme of that which Interpreters haue, for the deciding of this doubt, is this; God is open handed to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he fills all things liuing with his plenteouſneſſe; but yet ſo, that theſe three rules be obſerued: The <hi>first</hi> is, that this filling bee not alwaies vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of an immoderate filling, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inſatiable deſires of the fleſh, this, God oftentimes debarres his owne ſeruants of; but of ſuch a filling, as is ſufficient to content our weake na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:8072:144"/>withall. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that wee performe the condition which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at our hands, that is, that we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and take paines in a lawfull voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>third,</hi> that this exception be inſerted, <hi>quatenus ſcil. expedire Deus nouerit,</hi> ſo farre God will fill vs, as he ſhall ſee it to be profitable and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for vs.</p>
                  <p>The laſt benefit of God, mentioned in my Text, concernes the mind, <hi>in that he fills our hearts with gladneſſe:</hi> and here the Heart is likewiſe taken for the whole Man: for as the heart hath a principall function in conuerting our food to our ſubſtance, ſo hath it no leſſe a place in exciting and ſtirring vp the affection of gladneſſe. <hi>Philoſophie</hi> tells vs, that as when a man apprehends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtaſtefull obiect, the heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts it ſelfe, and ſo the outward mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, wanting the ſpirits which the heart was wont to ſend forth, tremble, and waxe pale and wan, and the whole man becomes ſtraight affected with ſome vntunable paſſion, ſo when one
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:8072:145"/>conceiues a pleaſing obiect, the heart dilates it ſelfe, and ſends forth ſpirits into the outward parts to proſecute the thing it liketh, whereby the whole man becomes more liuely and gladſome then before, in which reſpect it may be ſaid, that God which giues content and ioy vnto a man, doth fill likewiſe his heart with gladneſſe. Now, there is a double gladneſſe, the one ariſing from things temporall; the other, from things eternall; both come from God, and therefore neither ſimply to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued; but I chiefly commend to your beſt endeauors the latter, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a relation vnto it, the former is neither good nor ſolid. For if our true gladneſſe were founded vpon things temporall, then (me thinkes) wealth, and honour, or authoritie ſhould haue the principall place in effecting it; if <hi>Wealth,</hi> then ſhould rich men neuer be ſadde; if <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Authoritie,</hi> then ſhould Princes and Monarchs neuer be penſiue or diſquieted; but, O theſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wights, they fixe not their thoughts
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:8072:145"/>ſo ſtrongly vpon the bags they haue, as vpon thoſe they would haue, or haue had and haue not; and loe, their glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is now turned into ſorrow and vexation of ſpirit. A Princes temples are not ſo compaſſed with a Crowne, as his mind beſieged with cares, nor is he ſo lifted vp with the ſplendour of his traine, as caſt downe with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his feares. The heart of man therefore (as ſome wittily note) is made of the forme of a <hi>triangle,</hi> but the world is <hi>round,</hi> implying, that if the heart of man ſhould containe the whole world within it, yet as a <hi>circle</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within a <hi>triangle,</hi> cannot fill the <hi>triangle</hi> ſo compleatly, but that alwaies there will be left void ſpaces in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles or corners for more to be put in; ſo can it not be, that the heart ſhould be ſo filled or ſatisfied with the world, but that alwaies it would craue ſomething aboue it, and ſomething beyond it. Now, if it be true which <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> teach vs, that numbers in <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticke</hi> doe beare a proportion to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:8072:146"/>in <hi>Geometrie,</hi> this ſmall <hi>triangle</hi> of man, the Heart, muſt be filled by the fruition of that glorious Trinitie which created it. Tranſitorie bleſſings may indeed a little content it; but yet they leaue corners for ſorrowes, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and anguiſhes to harbour in: the ſacred Trinitie fills all the roomes, leaues no chinke for diſtractions to creepe in; of all the men therefore, that I know, he onely which contemplates that Maieſtie, is filled with true glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for, how can any ſparke of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content ſeize vpon that breaſt, where there is Fountaine of liuing water, and where God hath founded a whole <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean</hi> of ioy to extinguiſh it.</p>

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:8072:146"/>your Cellers with Wine, to glad your hearts; and your Cruzes with Oyle, to giue you cheerefull countenances: what remaynes, but (what was the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> counſell to the <hi>Lyſtrians</hi> in this place) that with thankfulnes and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe we ſhould turne vnto him, who hath by ſo many benefits witneſſed himſelfe vnto vs. Be not deceiued (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued) I mind not to diſſwade you, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from worſhipping, or adoring thoſe gods which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> with ſuch zeale diſſwaded the <hi>Lyſtrians</hi> from: thankes bee to God, you haue not ſo learned <hi>Christ,</hi> as to want Inſtructers in this matter.

                  <p>So then, you ſee, with what cautions the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and by his example, euery good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> may take a view of the ceremonies of other Religions, it muſt be for the <hi>manner</hi> without offence, for the <hi>Perſon</hi> without danger of peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and for the <hi>occaſion,</hi> it muſt bee a ciuill reſpect and not any idolatrous purpoſe; but firſt for the <hi>Poſition.</hi>

                  <p> The Poſition ſeemes to ſound, that to be preſent at idolatrous ceremonies, or to view and take a full ſight of their ſuperſtitions, is a thing in it ſelfe not wholly vnlawfull. But the eaſier it will appeare, if we make a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did now at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and what the Scriptures doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, hath beene done by the <hi>Saints</hi> at other times. To omit therefore violent coaction, when by conſtraint or force a man is compelled to be preſent at ſuch ſuperſtitions, of which there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; do we not reade how a Prophet of the Lords, was ſent to tell his errand to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> as hee ſtood by the Altar, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to his Calues, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 13. how <hi>Eliah</hi> beheld the <hi>Baalites</hi> offering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe vnto their <hi>Baal,</hi> and that from early morning to noone-tide, and that without diſturbing them, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18. how <hi>Moſes</hi> refuſed not to bee preſent at the enchantments of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. nor the three Children at the adoration of the golden Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.

Yet let me ſay, that hee is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Captaine, which plods only vpon his owne ranke, and reflects not his eye ſomtimes vpon his Enemies order and diſpoſure. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> knew well, that he was to reſcue <hi>Athens,</hi> not from <hi>Romes</hi> juriſdiction, but from the Deuills ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie; he vnderſtood, how that hee was to ſubdue the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and to captiuate their minds to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Faith, and therefore as a politike Generall, hee pryes into the weakneſſes of the Aduerſarie; he lookes
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:8072:156"/>about him, to ſee what quarter the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil had left vnfortified with the ſtrength of ſeeming Arguments, what Tower hee might batter downe vpon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies head.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then may you perceiue the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aſſumed, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding theſe deuotions of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But this were to giue the reynes to all licentious impietie, ſhould wee here reſt.

                  <p>That it was lawfull for the Gentiles to erect Altars, and offer ſacrifices needs no prouing, for before the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:8072:165"/>an Altar, Gen.</hi> 8. Now, though Altars and Sacrifices were of ſuch antiquitie and generalitie amongſt the Nations, yet as <hi>Toſtatus</hi> notes,<note place="margin">Toſtat. in <hi>16.</hi> Leuit.</note> the caſe betweene the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in offering them was differing; for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might ſacrifice; firſt, where they would: ſecondly, with what liuing Creatures they liſted, ſo as cleane: thirdly, with what ceremonies they pleaſed, ſo as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; whereas the <hi>Iewes</hi> were limited and reſtrayned for the <hi>Place,</hi> to the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie; for the <hi>Oblations,</hi> to certayne Creatures; and for <hi>Rites,</hi> to ſuch as were preſcribed in the Mount.

I am not ignorant, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men are of diuers minds and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning it, but I take that the ſumme of all in briefe ſpoken by them, may bee this. Partly, they might vſe them by Tradition, from thoſe which
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:8072:165"/>had beene the firſt planters of Colonies in the World, after the confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> and had themſelues ſeene them obſerued by <hi>Noah</hi> and other Patriarchs which then liued: partly, they might creepe in by the Deuils cunning, who the ſooner to cloake his deuices, and to paint them ouer with faire colours, turnes oftentimes Gods Ape, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates him in his beſt actions: partly, they might bee entertayned by mens policie, which the better to keepe the people in awe, and to knit them the more firmely together, did inuent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne rites and ceremonies for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, amongſt which theſe of Altars and Sacrifices, ſeemed to worke more impreſſion in mens minds, then the reſt: <hi>Vt quos ratio non poſſet, eos adoffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium religio duceret</hi> (ſaith the Orator) that whom reaſon could not perſwade, thoſe Religion might maſter: partly, they might receiue much furtherance from mens conſciences, which being guiltie of rebellion to God, did queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe, promote and aduance theſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:8072:166"/>as who ſhould ſay, that by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice on an Altar, muſt the Maker of Heauen and Earth bee reconciled vnto his creatures. But naturall reaſon could not direct them the way, to find out the true ſcope and buit, at which all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Altars did tend, <hi>Quamuis homo norit Deum eſſe, &amp; eſſe optimum maximum, non norit tamen patrem in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio reconciliatum</hi> (ſay Diuines) though man by the light of nature knowes that there is a God, and that this God is Goodneſſe it ſelfe, yet the Father recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled in the Sonne, he knowes not. <hi>No man knowes the Father but the Sonne, nor the Sonne, but he to whom hee hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him.</hi> Theſe things were wonders to the bleſſed Angels, much more are they myſteries vnto naturall men. Nature rather ſhewed the neceſſitie of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; then what that Sacrifice ſhould be, it reade, as it were, a Lecture vnto man of his wretchedneſſe, but bade him go to the Schooles of the Prophets to learne the remedie; ſo that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all, it brought him vnto
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:8072:166"/>death, ſomething muſt die for him, but there left him. Whereupon it was, that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in this thick miſt of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, being not able to ſee the marke at which their Altars did ayme, fell foully ſhort &amp; wide in applying them; firſt, in attributing to the Sacrifices, which they offered vpon the Altar, a vertue, ſomewhat reſembling the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts <hi>opus operatum,</hi> to pacifie the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God; <hi>Thure Deum placa,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe God with Frankincenſe (ſaith the Poet) they conſidered not, that from vs to God the way is vnpaſſable, if God himſelfe be not our way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to come thither. Secondly, they failed in the end, in not reſpecting in all theſe things the death of Chriſt: the Poets queſtion ſhould haue beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter canuaſſed by them, <hi>Cum ſis ipſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens moritur cur victima pro te,</hi> ſeeing that thou art guiltie; tell mee why the Beaſt dies for thee? this indeed ſhould haue beene their proteſtation, That whereas the ſilly innocent Beaſts did ſuffer death, it was they themſelues
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:8072:167"/>which deſerued it both in body and ſoule, and therefore without a further reference, then the ſhedding of the bloud of a Beaſt; well might <hi>Lucian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride <hi>Iupiter</hi> for delighting in the ſmell of carkaſſes: and it was truely ſaid of <hi>Hierocles,</hi> that their Sacrifices were to the fire but a feeding thereof with fuell and vapours, and to the Prieſts a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous maintenance of butcherie, I will adde, and to their Altars an inſtitution but of a new ſhambles.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue you briefly ſeene the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of Altars amongſt the Gentiles, their originall, and withall the abuſe of them: let vs now trauell from <hi>Athens</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> from the World vnder the Law, to the World vnder the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and conſider what it is, wherein we are to imitate theſe Gentiles; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Altars, and what it is wherein wee muſt leaue and forſake them. Altars, as they are properly ſo taken, for thoſe on which the <hi>typicall</hi> or ſuppoſed reall Sacrifices were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, are now ceaſed and taken away.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:8072:167"/>Our Sauiour, when he was lifted vp vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe, bad Altars to bee beaten downs; when hee rent the veile of the Temple, the Earth-quake ſhooke their foundation; when he died, their parts were acted and went out.
